# Plan and layout review

For read-only review, inspect the relevant PLAN root and children, layout, accepted design and SPEC, active feature plan if any, and the current repository tree where placement matters. Check that phase and milestone exits are objective, dependencies and integration points are feasible, every significant contract has a delivery route, and physical ownership supports the logical boundaries. Report concrete gaps and conflicting authorities without editing governing documents.

Check that the earliest usable milestone is a minimal meaningful end-to-end slice, its inclusions/deferrals and acceptance are explicit, and each delaying prerequisite is justified. Check subsequent capability increments are behaviorally bounded, retain the working path, and include timely integration/regression evidence rather than postponing it to a final phase. A skeleton or mocked-only demonstration is insufficient by itself. At suitable milestones, check demonstrable functionality, relevant usability/risk evidence, and the consequential human decision being informed; distinguish technical exits from product/usefulness decisions.

Check that strategy belongs in PLAN, physical ownership in layout, behavior in SPEC, and executable units and status in TASKS or active FEATURE-TASKS. Check alignment with PROJECT, ARCHITECTURE, DECOMPOSITION, and SPEC. Review parent-child links and component-to-path routing in both directions, including tests, documentation, and integration. Read the main PLAN and layout nodes as standalone end-state descriptions without editing-history language; genuine compatibility and transition obligations may refer to an earlier released state.

Report concrete gaps and affected task-list dependencies. Direct corrections belong to [delivery plan](delivery-plan.md) or [physical layout](physical-layout.md); incorporation of accepted feature documents belongs to **sdd-integrate-feature**. A review does not authorize edits, task execution, or progression into another workflow.

## Required PLAN/SPEC QC gate

Apply **sdd-conventions**' **Development-document QC**. Establish current SPEC/design QC evidence for the accepted inputs; a material unresolved specification issue blocks dependent planning. Map every significant accepted contract and end-to-end obligation to a planned delivery route, including honest deferrals, failures, dependencies and objective exits. Identify omissions, duplication, invented features and scope drift. Verify that layout supports the accepted structure and planned integration; a layout-only review reports its affected PLAN implications without authorizing PLAN edits.

For each phase, report delivery milestone count separately from its final dedicated phase review milestone. Apply shared 3–5 guidance, explicit 1–2 fragmentation and 10+ overload/drift assessments, departure rationale and empty-group rules. Inspect semantic scope even for in-range groups: contract/component breadth, delayed usefulness, dependency chains, integration/testing effort and boundary overhead. Keep justified narrow phases; add no padding or quota-driven splits. Dedicated milestone review outcomes remain required even though excluded from delivery counts.

Authoring includes authorized bounded PLAN/layout correction, recheck and `PLAN-REVIEW-REPORT.md` adjacent to PLAN (FEATURE-PLAN counterpart beside its root); the report covers applicable children and relevant layout. Use sdd-report's **Document QC reports** format and append Revision N cycles. Route changed behavioral/design decisions upstream; never rewrite SPEC to fit PLAN. Persist the corrected strategy and review together before TASKS generation. Pure review does not amend strategy. Missing/stale evidence or confirmed unresolved issues blocks dependent generation; explicit exceptions remain recorded as exceptions, not Ready.

## Human checkpoints

- **PLAN:** Present the completed and published PLAN for human review before preparing a dependent layout.
- **layout:** Present the completed and published layout for human review before generating TASKS.

Apply [human document review](../../sdd-manage/references/human-document-review.md) for acceptance and applicable preapproval.
