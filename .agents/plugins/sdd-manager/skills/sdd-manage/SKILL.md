# Coordinate specification-driven development

## Role and scope

Translate the user's objective into a scoped workflow and coordinate the responsible skills. Establish context, select or recover the path, check shared readiness, pass work to its focused owner and return the reached boundary. These instructions support direct coordinator entry without requiring PLUGIN.md; load only the relevant skills and references.

Proactively identify relevant capabilities, unresolved decisions, coordination gaps and blockers at entry, preparation handoff, phase activation and completion. Apply the shared [Markdown style](../sdd-conventions/references/markdown-style.md) to authored or reviewed Markdown, including direct calls.

## Shared gates

- **Authority:** Use the request and established decisions as authorization; proceed with routine work within that scope without repeated confirmation. Discussion, assessment or review alone does not authorize repairs. Check scope/instructions/pending decisions before each work unit and both path and proposed change before a user-file write under [scope checks](references/coordination.md#scope-checks-and-reporting-detail). Enter at the requested eligible stage and preserve the human's actual stopping boundary.
- **Git and pending work:** Repository mutations require an eligible worktree and established change ownership. Read-only discussion/inspection can proceed outside Git. Preserve valid and unrelated work; dirty state alone does not justify reset. Apply [coordination prerequisites](references/coordination.md#establish-scope-and-prerequisites).
- **Continuity:** Load [checkpoint and recovery](references/continuity.md) at composite entry/reconstruction, milestone/phase review, revision finalization and nested/steering return, including focused calls affecting an active workflow. Maintain `docs/dev/HANDOFF.md` at those boundaries; recover later work from owning records and Git, without per-commit handoff updates.
- **Human document review:** Honor explicit scoped future-checkpoint preapproval; otherwise pause after each necessary new PROJECT, ARCHITECTURE, DECOMPOSITION, SPEC, PLAN, layout and TASKS proposal under [human document review](references/human-document-review.md). PLAN/layout have separate checkpoints; broad workflow authority does not preaccept new documents. Reuse acceptable existing inputs without mandatory interactive replay.
- **Publication:** [Push/read back every owned commit](references/git-workflows.md#publish-each-commit) before further work or another commit, including direct focused calls. Unresolved publication blocks progression; the linked task-recovery exception permits only necessary correction/check/evidence work for an unsafe retained completion. Explicit scoped local-only/deferred instructions remain exceptions.
- **Task closure:** For TASKS/FEATURE-TASKS implementation, enforce the [task commit contract](../sdd-implement/references/completion-and-checkpoints.md#task-commit-contract): one executable task's verified result, evidence and initial owning checkbox close together. The implementation owner performs closure and the bounded [audit](../sdd-implement/references/completion-and-checkpoints.md#task-persistence-audit-and-recovery) on continuation and before applicable integration; resolve violations only within actual recovery authority. DOCS_TASKS initialization, first approvals and package QC follow [main preparation](references/main-preparation.md) under coordinator ownership.
- **Requested tracking:** Before implementation handoff, establish the [tracking decision](references/tracking-decision.md) and [phase activation](references/phase-activation.md). An explicit request is confirmation. Required objects/associations must be verified; pending or unknown projection blocks dependent execution. Pass the actual decision/readiness or blocker to the owner.
- **Preparation:** [Merge, verify and publish accepted preparation](references/branch-management.md#preparation-integration-gate) into the actual default branch before dependent implementation branching. Campaign plans/reports retain their revision branch.
- **Integration and stops:** Use the [eligible Git boundary](references/git-workflows.md): incomplete main phases push/pause; integrate only complete authorized boundaries. Human-requested implementation ranges define stops. Steering returns without task resumption; a completed child does not authorize parent continuation.
- **History:** Preserve [closed campaign records](../sdd-conventions/references/review-campaigns.md#closed-campaign-records) outside routine loading and validation; consult selected history only for a specific need. Load [revision modes](references/revision-modes.md) before nested work or selected eligible reopening, preserving suspension/return and actual authority.
- **Main preparation:** Load [main preparation](references/main-preparation.md) before any fresh/resumed main documentation repository write: enabled `docs-main` projection precedes writes; DOCS_TASKS owns initialization, first approvals and package QC; published documentation integration precedes milestone closure and the final implementation checkpoint.
- **Bootstrap:** Load [repository bootstrap](references/repository-bootstrap.md) before greenfield exploration or the first SDD persistence operation; reuse valid disclosure/usage records and respect selected path limits.

## Coordination cycle

1. **Establish or recover the baseline.** Identify the project, objective, requested operation, authoritative inputs and stop. Reuse sufficient current evidence; obtain **sdd-orient**'s scoped repository/instruction/Git/pending-work observations where missing or stale. Establish that evidence before selecting and announcing the path. Refresh it only when material state or scope changes.
2. **Select, load and explain the path.** Apply [workflow selection and continuity](references/workflows.md#workflow-selection-and-continuity): choose the core workflow/variant or standalone operation, assess continuation, stage/range change or switching, and load its governing instructions before the definitive evidence-backed decision in chat or dependent work. Honor requested reporting detail and [profile](references/coordination.md#reporting-profiles) (Standard by default) while keeping consequential decisions and checkpoints visible under [reporting guidance](references/coordination.md#scope-checks-and-reporting-detail). At composite-workflow entry/switch or context reconstruction, use [Explicit bootstrap reporting](references/coordination.md#composite-workflow-bootstrap-reporting), explain available profiles and announce the subsequent level. Preserve narrow requests and ask only for consequential missing decisions. Routine unchanged continuation reuses its selection.
3. **Establish readiness and hand off.** Follow the [coordination protocol](references/coordination.md), applying the shared gates before dependent authoring/execution. Carry the actual scope, authority, accepted inputs, readiness, unresolved decisions and stop; load the selected owner's instructions. **sdd-implement** owns range selection, task execution and persistence; **sdd-steer** owns checkpoint amendments; **sdd-integrate-feature** owns accepted feature reconciliation. Report unavailable capabilities rather than claim they ran.
4. **Assess results and blockers.** Collect actual outputs, evidence, changed state and remaining differences under [coordination execution](references/coordination.md#coordinate-execution). Return repairs and unresolved decisions to their proper owner; governing-document amendments raised by **sdd-docs** remain with the human before authoring. A standalone verification/review does not start implementation.
5. **Persist, integrate and return.** Coordinate non-task repository persistence and eligible integration through [Git workflows](references/git-workflows.md); implementation/steering retain their own commit procedures. Use **sdd-report** and [return results](references/coordination.md#return-results) to distinguish planned, implemented, verified, committed, pushed and hosted states, report limits/pending decisions and stop at the authorized boundary.

## Reference routing

Use each reference's scope and load conditions below to select it before reading its contents.

### Context and coordination

| Reference | Scope and boundary | Load when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [workflows.md](references/workflows.md) | Core workflow/variant selection, read-only workflow loading, continuity, supporting operations and release dispatch | Workflow context is insufficient, a workflow explanation/loading is requested, a request may change the path/stage/stop, or highlights, complete messages, packaging or release publication is requested |
| [coordination.md](references/coordination.md) | Shared prerequisites, scope checks/reporting profiles, handoff payload, execution/persistence, results and environment recovery; focused skills retain their procedures | Coordinating scope/reporting, readiness, a handoff, blockers, non-task persistence or returned results |
| [examples.md](references/examples.md) | Representative requests and expected boundaries; examples do not grant authority | Checking a request interpretation or workflow boundary against a representative case |

### Preparation and adoption

| Reference | Scope and boundary | Load when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [agent-orientation.md](references/agent-orientation.md) | Root AGENTS.md maintenance preserving governing instructions | Creating/maintaining target-project orientation or updating affected instruction links |
| [main-preparation.md](references/main-preparation.md) | Main-only pre-write tracking, four-file initialization, DOCS_TASKS first approvals, package QC and final integration/checkpoint; document owners retain authoring | Entering/resuming main preparation, before its first repository write or a document completion/integration handoff |
| [repository-bootstrap.md](references/repository-bootstrap.md) | Initial exploration and disclosure/usage records; no implicit Git initialization | Before greenfield exploration or the first target-repository SDD commit |
| [human-document-review.md](references/human-document-review.md) | Entry review choice, new-document HIL and acceptable existing inputs | Entering/resuming preparation, creating a necessary proposal or resolving a pending/requested human review |
| [document-qc-gates.md](references/document-qc-gates.md) | Technical SPEC/PLAN/layout/TASKS readiness, distinct from human acceptance | Before dependent preparation, implementation or hosted projection, or when affected inputs need reassessment |

### Execution and continuity

| Reference | Scope and boundary | Load when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [continuity.md](references/continuity.md) | Repository checkpoint, branch selection, recovery since checkpoint and parent return; focused owners retain their procedures | Entering/reconstructing a composite workflow, refreshing its checkpoint, returning from child/steering work or preparing a transfer |
| [branch-management.md](references/branch-management.md) | Actual branch identities, setup, preparation integration and phase transitions | Creating/reusing workflow branches or changing an integration/phase boundary |
| [git-workflows.md](references/git-workflows.md) | Per-commit publication, verified integration/recovery and release commit/tag persistence | An owned commit needs publication, an eligible boundary needs integration, or Git/host recovery or release persistence is required |
| [credentials.md](references/credentials.md) | Repository token handling and Git/API authentication recovery; authentication is not operation authority | Discovering/saving/supplying hosting credentials or recovering an observed shell/API authentication failure |
| [tracking-decision.md](references/tracking-decision.md) | Optional hosting recommendation/confirmation and retained scope; separate from projection readiness | Establishing/recovering tracking choice before implementation handoff or handling an omitted requested gate |
| [phase-activation.md](references/phase-activation.md) | Eligible-phase hosted object/association verification and transition gates | Activating or reassessing required projection before task execution or a phase transition |

### Review and revision

| Reference | Scope and boundary | Load when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [prerelease-review.md](references/prerelease-review.md) | Explicit comprehensive prerelease review and advisory reminder; reminder does not activate review | A comprehensive prerelease review is selected or its release-readiness reminder is due |
| [revision-modes.md](references/revision-modes.md) | Nested parent suspension/return and authorized eligible reopening; ordinary history stays frozen | Opening work within an active campaign or selecting a closed-campaign amendment |
| [review-and-revision.md](references/review-and-revision.md) | Scoped review, accepted revision planning/execution and campaign evidence; assessment is distinct from repair | Planning/coordinating a review or accepted revision campaign, including direct focused amendments |
